    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: August 14, 2025</p>

  <section class="card">
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Numerix Simple</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).
      By using the App, you agree to the practices described here. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
    </p>
  </section>

  <h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We aim to collect only what is necessary to operate and improve the App.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Information you provide</strong>: numeric inputs, saved items (e.g., favorites, history), feedback you send us via email.</li>
    <li><strong>Device & usage data</strong> (non-identifying): device model, operating system, app version, basic event logs, and diagnostics (e.g., crashes, performance metrics).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information (e.g., government IDs, health, biometric, or precise geolocation) and do not create user profiles for advertising.</em></p>

  <h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide core features (number conversion, number facts, math properties).</li>
    <li>To improve stability, performance, and user experience.</li>
    <li>To fix bugs, analyze crashes, and prevent abuse.</li>
    <li>To respond to your inquiries and support requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Processing on Your Device</h2>
  <p>
    Many calculations and transformations occur locally on your device. Where cloud services are used (if any), we limit transmission to what is required for the feature to work.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited data in these cases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers</strong>: trusted vendors that help us operate the App (e.g., analytics, crash reporting). They must follow confidentiality and data protection obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong>: to comply with laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety</strong>: to protect our rights, users, or the public from harm or illegal activities.</li>
    <li><strong>Business changes</strong>: in a merger, acquisition, or asset transfer, data may be transferred as permitted by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy or as required by law. You may request deletion as described in <a href="#your-rights">Your Rights</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate action.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
  </p>

  <h2>8) International Users</h2>
  <p>
    Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of information as described in this Policy, subject to applicable law.
  </p>

  <h2 id="your-rights">9) Your Rights & Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access, correction, deletion</strong>: you may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your information, subject to legal limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out of analytics (where supported)</strong>: you may disable analytics or limit diagnostics in your device or OS privacy settings, if available.</li>
    <li><strong>Uninstall</strong>: you can stop all data collection by uninstalling the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10) Do Not Track</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals. We will update this notice if our practices change.
  </p>

  <h2>11) California Privacy Notice</h2>
  <p>
    If you are a California resident, you may have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by CPRA), including the right to know, delete, and correct certain information, and to limit use of sensitive personal information (which we do not intentionally collect). We do not sell or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.
  </p>

  <h2>12) GDPR Notice</h2>
  <p>
    Where the EU/UK GDPR applies, our legal bases may include: <em>performance of a contract</em> (to provide the App), <em>legitimate interests</em> (to improve and secure the App), and <em>consent</em> (when required). You may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict or object to processing, and data portability. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
  </p>

  <h2>13) Third-Party Links & Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may contain links to third-party content or use third-party services. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies. We encourage you to review them.
  </p>

  <h2>14) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be indicated by updating the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Policy.
  </p>
